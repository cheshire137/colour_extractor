# Colour Extractor

This is a Chrome extension that will let you pull the main five colors from a
page and create a palette with them on [ColourLovers.com](http://colourlovers.com). The extension currently only grabs colors from CSS used on the page, not
images.

## To-do List

- Pull colors from large images, including background images, on the page.
- Provide a color picker so you can choose your own colors from the page.

## Credits
