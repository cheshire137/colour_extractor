# Colour Extractor

This is a Chrome extension that will let you pull the main five colors from a
page and create a palette with them on [ColourLovers.com](http://colourlovers.com).

Goals:

- Look up existing colors on ColourLovers, show their names.
- Pull colors from large images, including background images, on the page.
